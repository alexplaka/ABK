This repository lists the Matlab files that I used while developing and testing the ABK algorithm, licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL v3.0.

The accompanying document that describes the theoretical underpinnings of the algorithm and its applications can be viewed at https://osf.io/x6h9b/ and is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0), https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/.
